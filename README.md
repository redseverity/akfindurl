# forcepath

**forcepath** is an automatic directory discovery tool written in Go that works without relying on static wordlists.

Unlike traditional tools that depend on large, predefined wordlists, **forcepath** takes a brute-force approach: it dynamically generates and tests subdirectory names in real time. This avoids the need to load massive lists into memory, making it faster, more memory-efficient, and suitable for adaptive directory enumeration.

Perfect for reconnaissance, Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and general web enumeration tasks.
