# akfindurl

**akfindurl** is an automatic directory discovery tool without wordlist written in Go.

Unlike traditional tools that depend on large, static wordlists, **akfindurl** takes a dynamic approach: it generates potential directory names on the fly and tests them in real-timce. This method avoids the need to load huge wordlists into memory, making it more memory-efficient and adaptable to different targets.

Ideal for reconnaissance, CTFs, or web enumeration tasks.
